## 💻 Requirements

Before you start, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Besides this it is good to have an editor to work with the code as: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 📜 How to Use

<b>Sequence of Steps - Using GitBash:</b>

  1. Create a folder where the files will go, you can do this using the command ```mkdir Folder_Name```.
  2. In GitBash, use the command ```cd Folder_Name``` to get into the folder.
  3. Still in GitBash, use the command ```git clone https://github.com/Pedro0901/Questions-And-Answers.git```to clone the repository.
  4. After that the files go straight into the folder you created and you can run the program or make changes to the code.

Inside the [repository](https://github.com/Pedro0901/Questions-And-Answers), go to "Code" and select the "Download zip" option. After the download you should extract this .zip file, using some program like [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) to unzip it.

Simply click on the file "Questions_and_Answers.exe" and run it.

  * ### 🤔 What is the functionality of the repository files?
    In the repository are present the .exe files, which are nothing more than the already compiled application, and also the .cpp file, which is the program's source code.
   
  * ### 🐞 Bugs
    If the program is not running, I recommend that you deactivate your anti-virus program, because since it is a program created by someone else, the anti-virus can accuse it as a virus even though it is not.
    
  * ### 🔝 Improvements
    This game was created just to put some things I learned in practice, it is not ready and I intend to improve it (a lot) in the future.
    
    <i><b>Ps: This game was created in July, 2020.</i></b>
